# 📊 Stats Calculator in C

A simple C program that takes a list of integers from the user and calculates:

- ✅ Total Sum  
- 🔼 Maximum Value  
- 🔽 Minimum Value  
- 📉 Average (with two decimal places)

This program uses dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`) to handle input of any size and demonstrates basic array handling, loops, conditionals, and arithmetic in C.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Compile the code:
```bash
gcc main.c -o stats
2. Run the program:
./stats
💻 Example Output
Enter the number of elements: 5
Enter number 1: 10
Enter number 2: 5
Enter number 3: 15
Enter number 4: 20
Enter number 5: 8

The numbers are: 10 5 15 20 8
The total sum is: 58
The max is: 20
The min is: 5
The average is: 11
